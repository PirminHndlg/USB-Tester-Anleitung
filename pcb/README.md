# USB Cable Tester

Simple board to test various USB cables! (Note the USB standard helps to identify these [USB-C](https://www.usb.org/usb-type-cr-cable-and-connector-specification), cables that are compliant with the standard will have selected pins according to [cable and connector specification release](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/USB%20Type-C%202.2%20Release%20202210%20%281%29.zip)). 

Plug in your cable to both sides and see which signals light up!

**FOR CABLE USE ONLY. DO NOT EVER PLUG THIS IN TO A DEVICE, THE PINS ON ONE SIDE ARE ALL SHORTED TOGETHER AND THAT COULD BREAK IT!**

## Ordering Pre-made Boards From JLCPCB
I have added instructions on how to order from JLCPCB in the [ORDERING](ORDERING.md) page.

## Assembly
Want to build your own? Take a look at the release [here](https://github.com/alvarop/usb_c_cable_tester/releases/tag/v2.0). There's a file called jlcpcb.zip which you can use to order bare boards or fully assembled ones from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/).
